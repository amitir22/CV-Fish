
0. setup all the hyper parameters in the notebook.ipynb .

1. update video_batch_processor.py to allow the hyper parameters to be injected from ipynb.

2. implement frame-pair processing:
    a function that receives all the hyper params, and 2 frames, and processing the 2 
    frames, outputting a few results in FramePairResults class to encapsulate it well.

3. all frame-pairs processing:
    for each frames window, calculate the movement matrix between the newest frame added, 
    to each of the other frames in the current window.
    for each pair, process the movement matrix into a 
    few output values (average, sum, product, ...) of vector magnitudes

4. add support of super pixel

5. add support of minimal+maximal frame spacings



list of hyper-parameters to play with and inject:
- super pixel dimensions: width(int) x height(int)
- number of frames in frame window (int)
- number of spacing of frames between comparisons (int)
  - which means that if 3 is given, then only pairs of frames that are 3 frames 
    apart at least are considered.
- capture device, use the cv2.VideoCapture class to inject it.
